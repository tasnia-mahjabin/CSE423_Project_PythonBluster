# CSE423_Project_PythonBluster <br>
<p>Players assume control of a brave defender in Python Blaster, who comes prepared
with a potent ball blaster at the bottom of the display. The player's task is to block
an impending snake that is made up of interconnecting balls that are all numbered.
Shooting each snake parts by matching the bullet and each ball amount of hits
needed to kill it is the goal. Players must aim and fire wisely as the snake descends
to keep it from getting to the opponent. To provide fluid, eye-catching visuals and
engaging gameplay mechanics, OpenGL and computational geometry methods
such as the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm, Midpoint Line
Algorithm, and Midpoint Circle Algorithm will be widely utilized in this game.</p>
